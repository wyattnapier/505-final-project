qlw1yy,"Why are other suicidal people so nice and understanding but all the while still wanting to kill themselves? It's kind of paradoxical, people who want to kill themselves are the only people capable of relating and stopping others from killing themselves. Maybe we all want to see people pull through it, maybe it gives us hope, maybe it gives us purpose...or maybe we think so lowly of ourselves that we dont wish anyone to feel that way. I'm not sure why I have a need to ensure others are cared for even if they aren't depressed it's as if I'm saying ""please dont become me, its torture"".","suicide intent, hopelessness",hopelessness,1.0,30

I would totally go back and get treatment at a hospital again if it werent for the horrible treatment of patients and the bill that would come along with it. My bill at my psych hospital was about $20,000. All because I wanted to jump off a bridge. You cant tell anyone that youre suicidal without them throwing you in a mental hospital, but you cant go to a mental hospital without owing thousands of dollars and being treated like a prisoner, just making your problems even worse. Theres no good solution. I want to have the right to die. Or at least get free help. The suicidal hotline doesnt do shit. I want real help. And not to be thrown in a hospital.

einosv,"Physical feeling of loniless in chest? Recently, Ive been having these incidents on average 4-5 times a day where for some seconds il have this intense feeling of loneliness and il feel it directly in my chest, almost like a feeling of my heart sinking. It usually lasts about 5 seconds around and almost always happens as Im waking up or going to bed, and maybe once or twice during the day. It could just happen once when it happens and go away, or happen 2 or 3 times in rapid succession. The feeling is very defeating and usually results in me crying momentarily. Ive never felt this way exactly before, only started happening around 2 months ago. I guess its probably the result of being lonely for a while. Im 19 and never had a real gf or relationship so that probably has to do with it. The feeling itself is pretty powerful, I imagine its what heartbreak feels like.

ukxbqb,"Tired now I love my husband, I will always be here for him, but fuck me if I could go back in time and tell 20 year old me 'get ready to brace, cos this ride is fucking relentless, it never ends, you can't relax when you think you can relax because they tread a line so fucking precarious any tiny deviation in life can mean weeks in bed and months of suicidal thinking, battling invisible deamons, and all you can do is hold him tight and tell him it will pass and it will be okay...only 17 years later you can hear the disbelief in your voice, you're not so sure it will be ok, it doesn't feel like it is passing, and the kick in the guts when they laugh with friends but you know deep down they are giving that moment all the energy, and it's so good for them to be connecting, but you just can't help feeling slightly resentful and feeling guilty for feeling that way'...just this.

17c64lr,I'm feeling extremely broken tonight. And its only worsening. Is there really hope? I'm an alcoholic. I have a 20 year eating disorder that just cant seem to get better. I have severe childhood trauma. I'm bipolar. Been off my meds for 2 months now. I'm 90k in debt. Going through a breakup. I'm crying as I'm typing this. I'm tired of living. I think I'm such a freaking good kind soul. I don't understand why all this has happened to me/or is happening to me. I would totally be gone if it wouldn't hurt my family.

14j3oex,"why has depression made me significantly more stupid? I mean, the title says it all. When I was a kid I had great memory, motor skills, was high honors etc now? I cant even remember what I was saying 5 minutes ago let alone 2 seconds ago. I cant spell as well I used to, I used to write books and in journals just for fun and pretty much every skill that includes being smart is gone. Theres so much more to it than even this I just dont have the energy to even type it all. I really try to be positive and hope one day that old me will come back but its been over 2 years at this point and I just dont feel like myself anymore. Does anybody have any kind of advice?

12pf291,"Life is not a blessing, It's a curse. I just don't see how you can view it differently. You're forced to work for your entire life and what do you get for it? You get to stop when your old and your brain doesn't even function properly anymore. I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy, let alone a person like me whose never harmed anyone a day in their lives. It almost feels like I wasn't destined for this life, as if I wasn't supposed to be born, yet was anyway. The sad part, however, is the fact that I'm too much of a coward to actually do anything about it. As a result, I'm forced to go through life without a second option, which makes me feel worse with each passing day. I'm just sick of it all. I just wish it was possible to not work and society didn't demonize people for just simply wanting an alternative to working.","hopelessness, suicide intent",loneliness,1.0,13

I tried explaining and showing them messages saying thats just how we talk in me and my guy friends group chat and that I have no feelings whatsoever for them. Now theyre not allowing them to speak to me ever again since the one name triggered them (not like a nickname but random rude names we call one another with our other friends). And as I dont respond their childish games they start to stop talking to one of my friends since they talk to me still and would only talk to them when Im not a school. Is this person toxic?

I've been having a tough time for a decade since I was 12, but I'm seeing a therapist at the moment which is really going well, and I have a very supportive boyfriend who loves me and reassures me but lately I've just been in this downward spiral of negative emotions and emotional tiredness, and I just want to talk to someone who doesn't know me, or all my other issues or my friends. Basically a stranger. Like I said I don't know if this is the right place, and I don't know if anyone would like to hear all my doubts and issues and fears, but if there's anyone out there I'd love to have an internet friend I can throw my thoughts to.

e23cc7,"I had my court date today, she couldn't even be bothered to show up. So my now ex wife, who moved out of my house and in with another guy, wanted this divorce so bad that she filed and then never showed up for a single court appearance. She filed and moved in with her new love interest and then never gave it another thought. I actually had to file a counter petition in order to get this thing finalized. I didn't want any of this but in typical fashion she set the thing in motion and never looked back. I did all the legwork on a divorce I didn't want from a woman I still love. But, I want volunteers not hostages. My kids stayed with me and they are the best thing to come from our 22 years together anyway.

I am an educated professional who is trying to learn or rediscover who I am in this crazy world. I am a very laid back and easy going guy. I am a foodie and a wine and coffee snob. I enjoy witty banter and well as deep intellectual conversations. I am always excited to learn from other people. I would prefer a female chat partner. Preferably within close to the same time zone I am in. 12 hour time difference would kind of defeat the purpose in my mind.,loneliness,hopelessness,1.0,12
