I had cried on a daily basis and even owned a gun (pistol) up until a few days ago, and all that lead me to have suicidal urges.

I've been seeing a therapist and even told my parents about the situation just a few days ago in which they offered to take my gun from me and sell it voluntarily. I'm so happy that they did that, but I still have thoughts of suicide very often but I'm glad there's no way for me it to actually pull it off anymore.

I cannot be the only one who has no one who reaches out to them when you really need someone? I remember posting in my Instagram story a really dark messaging just pouring my heart out... One person who I barely talk to just messaged saying thanks for sharing your story with us and hope you get things sorted, which I appreciated. But \"friends\", I've reached out to them all the time but I never get anything back and this makes my depression worse.

{"id": "11jmond", "text": "How to deal with anxiety triggered by criticism? ### Can I take constructive criticism? Generally, yes. However, getting criticized many times over little things gives me anxiety. That makes me angry because 1) I often times can‚Äôt escape the feeling of anxiety when criticized, 2) I try to be pretty agreeable to avoid displeasing people. So when that expectation isn‚Äôt met and people still criticize me, I get angry and resentful because it feels like there is nothing I can do to please them which makes me feel like there is no way to get away from my anxiety. I also end up feeling like a victim which makes me feel weak and disempowered which I hate. This also makes me angry lol. So my question is can I choose to not feel anxiety in situations like this, and how? If I can‚Äôt just choose not to feel it, how do I deal with it? What is the healthy end goal that I should have if ending the feeling of anxiety isn‚Äôt possible? Thanks everyone.", "emotions": ["anger"]}

And to still love him in this situation means that I have to let him go.

[These protests, to make it short, reflect widespread outrage](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/12/tech/reddit-blackout/index.html) over Reddit's decision to charge large fees for some third-party apps to continue accessing the platform. Many subs across the site starting today through the next few days, including very large subs and much smaller ones, are setting their content to \"private\" in protest, which means only pre-approved users can access the sub at all. The decision to not participate in the blackouts has nothing to do with the protests themselves or what they stand for, but instead the fact that this sub is a critical resource for people in very dangerous and traumatic situations, and as such I do believe it would also be dangerous to restrict access to the sub for so long, or at all.

I‚Äôve been lonely for quite some time (30yo+ some other social categories that predispose me for loneliness) and I wonder if anyone else here has noticed the sense of freedom that comes from not being tied to a group of people or a partner. ### Recently joined the military at a later age so, of course, I‚Äôm surrounded by these wholesome couples that are allegedly so great. But, as I‚Äôm here longer, I notice the lack of sincerity that comes with these partnerships and peer groups. (Of course there are a few that have really made the dream work) but for the most part it‚Äôs people surrounded by a lot of people with issues. So, I‚Äôm curious if anyone had at least noticed or acknowledged the benefit of being on your own. TLDR; does anyone else with exposure to different groups of people acknowledge the advantages or how pleasant it can be to be alone?", "emotions": ["loneliness"]}

I'm curious about how single and unmarried individuals without family spend their time. We all know that having a support system and loved ones around can make a significant difference in our lives, but there are also those who navigate life on their own. If you fall into this category or know someone who does, I'd love to hear about how you spend your time and make the most of your independence. Do you have any unique hobbies, activities, or routines that keep you engaged and fulfilled? Are there any challenges you face as a result of not having immediate family members to rely on? I believe that hearing about your experiences can provide valuable insights and inspiration to others in similar situations. So, please feel free to share your thoughts and suggestions. Let's create a supportive space where we can learn from each other and celebrate the diverse ways in which we lead fulfilling lives even without a traditional family structure.

But the absolute worst thing about it, is not that I am alone, it is the feeling that there will never be anyone to share what I've been through with. It just amplifies the loneliness, and adds a whole new layer of fuck you to the situation. And I'm pretty certain that professional help would be ineffective too, as there has never been a particularly useful visit to the psychiatrist about it. I've gotten help for my anxieties, my depression and every other problem I've had, but every time I go to a psychiatrist about loneliness, the reaction seems to be somewhat lukewarm, as if it is not a problem on the same scale as depression or anxiety etc. Where the hell does the additude towards loneliness come from, where it's no \"worth as much\" as a problem as some others may be?

Ofcourse that was a very bad decision because as soon as things started to heat up, he got nervous, stressed out and sad. End result: me having to comfort him for 4 hours. When he didn't respond to me for over an hour I got out of bed and went to my hobbyroom for some space. Within 15 minutes he came over for a cuddle, asked me to help him make some lunch and now he's all smiles and cuddles again. My head is exploding... I'm.. so confused and sad..

I wanted to share that through a lot of grieving and processing I am pretty sure my ex was narcissistic. I think definitely covert through. I broke up with her back in December. My reasons are that: 1. She loved attention weather good or bad 2. Minimized my struggles 3. Very controlling wanted me around her 24/7. 4. Tracked me on her phone 5. Talked about getting married/kids very early on. 6. Lived in this fantasy of this great life we would have. 7. Would cry Iike a little kid at any trouble in the relationship. This is just the basics but reading more about narcissism has helped me understand the trauma bonds I formed with her. As well as to why I felt so addicted to her post breakup. I hope this helps you in some way. This stuff hits really hard. If you have any questions post below I would love to talk to you.", "emotions": ["substance abuse"]}

Loneliness is when people treat you differently because they can tell there is something wrong with you. They give you a look of pity, indifference, disgust or smug arrogance. Loneliness is having no one to love you when you feel down, no one to support you when you're struggling, no one to help you up when you fall, and no one to encourage you when you feel discouraged. Loneliness is feeling completely and totally useless and unlovable because you are alone when near everyone else is surrounded by people who care for them.

When my husband and I got married we were both earning enough money to get by. Then his depression got worse and he's now been out of work for 3 years. I pay our rent and all the bills. Before, I was saving in the hope of one day getting a mortgage, but now there's never anything left at the end of the month. His depression also means that it's impossible to make plans for the future - he says he can't see any future. Talking about it plunges him into self-hatred. So the idea of moving flat (to somewhere cheaper) feels about as plausible as moving to the moon. I know this is really dangerous for our future. We have no assets and nothing saved against the future. But I don't know what to do about it.
